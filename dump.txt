[u"It was my first visit to Jaipur, it took 2. 3 hours to reach there by train. Love the street food over there. Hotel Rani Mahal is the place where we stayed for 2 days. Being a photo hunter I love colors and yes it's pick city indeed. For non-veg it's not a heaven as availability of quality non-veg food is matter of question there but overall it's all about fort, museum history and glory of Indian culture. You can go for shopping also, few things are quite cheap like leather, traditional Rajasthani clothes. Dal bati churma was a value addition, I must say.", u'The city Jaipur is worth seeing. All sites are good but city traffic is congested. Everyone shall see City palace, hawa mahal, three forts and city. There forts speak about history. Shish Mahala on Amber fort is worth seeing.', u'Everyone can shop Rajastani garments and things.', u'The capital of Rajasthan, filled with beautiful palaces, museums, an amazing 18th century outdoor celestial observatory, a huge bustling market where you can find fabrics and jewellery, a city surrounded by forts on steep hills where you can ride elephants, but also full of honking tuk-tuks and new construction. The very essence of changing India, full of excitement and energy.', u'Overall good experience but history wise not very strong like Delhi or Agra.

[u'It was my first trip to Udaipur. Udaipur is very nice place to spent your quality time with your family. You can find everything there like palace, lake, sunset view, mountain view, wild life, shopping and special the pride of Rajasthan Folk Dance. There are few good kind of restaurant which serves a lot of delicious food. Uber made travelling very easy.', u'Udaipur is historic city but very costly for tourist.', u'Like city palace entry cost 280 per head, Camera fee 250, Even parking fee is 150 rs. What is that for. Just to give money to Mewar maharajas for doing nothing.', u'Every other sightseeing place has some or other type of entry fee.', u"One can't say that to maintain fees are needed. Take examples of Kankaria lake Ahmedabad where nominal charges are there yet perfectly managed. Sayaji garden, Baroda. Where no entry charge and perfectly maintained.", u"It's just because of foreign visitors crowd all things are getting high enough. Local tourist should not charge more.", u'Other than city palace nothing is worth watchin or out of pocket for common people. Like crystal galarry yentry fee 550 per head. Boat ride 700 per head.', u'Very costly for common people.', u'Location difficult to access with 4-wheeler,', u'All rooms are on 1st floor & above ... But there is no lift and there is nobody to carry luggage to the room,', u'Poor water connection and minimum amenities not provided in the bathroom,', u'No phone to call even the reception,', u'No TV.', u"I must admit that my trip to Udaipur has been one of the most cherished. I can't help it but I get hell bent on making people go there if they haven't and trust me once back from there, they feel & do the same.", u'Maybe my love for it is because of the forts and palaces, the rich heritage and so many things to see and explore. All in all a grand wholesome package.', u'Four full days are good enough to see most of the places and some famous places around it. So, here is what all you can do in this trip:', u'1. Forts - Chittorgarh Fort, Kumbhalgarh Fort', u'2. Palaces - City Palace, Jag Mandir Palace', u'3. The Royal Vintage Car Collection Display', u'4. Temples/Mandir - Jagdish (Vishnu) Mandir, Eklingji, Ranakpur Temple, Saas Bahu Mandir', u'5. Lakes - Pichola, Fateh Sagar', u'6. Maharana Pratap Memorial, Ropeway to the highest point of Udaipur, Saheliyon ki Baari', u'7. Walk down the lanes of the city to enjoy their culture, food and art.', u'Quite an interesting listing! If you have not been there you know where to head next.', u'Udaipur is a nice and lovely place in South of Rajasthan and having great things to watch and to do also..', u'Well I went along with my 4 friends from New Delhi using train and stayed at Hotel Savera near Railway station. Hotel is nice and good clean rooms. Cooperative staff and FO Mr. Vikas Owner.. Food was nice and reasonable.', u'Near by market was good and cheap with great variety of food and other things to purchase.', u"We travelled to lot of places in Udaipur including Famous Haldighati and Nathdwara Temple & Eklingji Temple all in 1200 bucks for 7 seater bolero, it's all for one day.", u'Local sightseeing was good including Saheli ki bari, City Palace, Maharana Pratap museum and statue was just amazing. View from the top was lovely from Maharana Pratap Statue... Few more places also all in 650 bucks for whole day.', u'Trip was lovely with great Rajasthani food including Dal baati.', u'Costs around 12500 bucks for 5 people including food, travel, hotel and vehicle for sightseeing in Udaipur...', u'Possitive points are staff is very cooperative helpful service is excelant. Improvement require in logistic and food charges. Resort is byond city boundary and normal taxi charges are exorbitant. Uber do not serve. And mangment outsourced transort who charge very high. This need to correct else members wll not recomand this resort.', u'I planned for a day trip of it and took a bus for the sightseeing. It was Rishabh travels of Udaipur and they charge around 300 for a day tour.', u'The nicest place to see in Udaipur is the City Palace and I would recommend to spent at-least 2-3 hours in that place. You can go for boating in the backyard of that place and I bet you will enjoy that ride and the view more than anyone else.', u'Udaipur is one of the most beautiful cities of India. We have gone to Udaipur for 2 nights 3 days', u'Here can be the suggested plan', u'1 day one- land at Udaipur by 11am and after quick hotel check-in, you can plan to visit Kumbhalgarh and Haldighati area or you can go to Nathdwara if you want add religious element in the trip. Return to hotel by 8pm and can plan to have dinner in the hotel. Book a table on the rooftop or lakeside restaurant, if the hotel is near lake', u'Day 2- local city visit', u'Start your day early and go to monsoon palace fr 30 minutes then city palace for 2 hrs with guide. Lunch at Natraj restaurant is must. Post lunch proceed to see vintage car meuseum and then you can spend lot of time boating, joying lake view, visiting jag mandir, gardens etc', u'You can quickly visit local shopping market while returning back to hotel. Or can visit bagor ko haveli in the evening to enjoy local music and dance program of 1 hr', u'Book a table near lake side at the ambrai restaurant for dinner. I will give this place 5 out of 5. And a must visit place', u'One can skip the following in udaipur- saheliyon ki baadi, doodh talai, sukhadiya circle etc', u'Day 3- checkout from hotel and proceed to hotel', u"Udaipur in monsoon is simply superb with greenery all around and lakes full. There are so many places of interest to visit. City has so much to offer in the form of architecture, art and culture that keeps one totally engrossed and busy. Travel to Mt Abu through picturesque lush green mountains can be another wonderful experience. Udaipur is truly a city of lakes. During monsoons it's beauty of lakes can be best experienced.", u"Nice time in Udaipur. Great scenic beauty. I actually liked the foreign market and the cafe's over there. Reasonable food, walking distance to most of the sightseeing from there. Also I like the zoo and the Monsoon palace at the hill top. Must see the cultural programme at Bagore ki Haveli from 7 to 8 evening. City palace is very well maintained loved watching the palace. Vintage car museum has a great collection but less in number and it's quite expensive 250 per person. But I would say go for it. We stayed at hotel Rampratap palace and it was a great decision. Loved the lake view from hotel. So overall we had fun. To all travellers just one thing if your going to stay in Udaipur don't stay in a hotel instead stay in a resort near lakes and mountains. Also stay in a resort which looks like a palace. It will be fun. You have great option over there.", u'Enjoy. Still miles to go !!!']

You will not feel safe there. It's better to go to other hill station rather than spending huge amount in Kashmir.", u'There are so many places in India where you can relax. Himachal and Uttarakhand are the safest place and beauty of hills are also there.', u'Do not plan with your family ever to visit that place.', u'A must visit place.', u'Things to do- House Boat stay near Dal Lake, Shikara ride on Dal Lake.

But I could skip it in my next visit.", u"Sadly Srinagar has been ruined with plastic bottles littered in parts of the lake and weeds that have made the water so dirty.

[u'Jodhpur, a city of culture and heritage, is one of the astounding cities in the India.', u'Known as Bluecity and Suncity, Jodhpur has its own built legacy of historic monuments. This review has been long overdue but as they say, "Its better late than never"', u'It is covered from hills and rocks from all four directions and its main charm is you can have everything here. From lip smacking food to adventurous tasks, from peaceful stay to wild long drives, Jodhpur has all.', u'Now come to the places one must not skip. Mehrangarh Fort, Umaid Palace, Mandore Garden, Tripoliya Market, Kaylana Lake are some of the main tourists attractions. The Mehrangarh Fort, with its beauty, is the living proof of the hard work and skill of the Jodhpuri sculptors. Take a look of Museum in fort and you will love it. It is beautifully laid out. It has a palanquin section where you can see a wide collection of old royal palanquins. The heritage of the Rathores, including arms, costumes, paintings, decorated period rooms, etc, is exhibited in the museum. The museum gives us an idea of the grandeur of the royal families of the past.', u'One can have beautiful view of BLUE CITY from top of the fort. Jasvant Thada is again a must visit. It is very nearly situated to the Fort.', u'Ganesh Mandir, Pal Balaji, Samrat Ashok Garden, Masuria Pahadi, Bhim Bhadak Cave, Siddhnath Shiv Temple, Ranchordas ji Temple are some fantastic places one must explore in Jodhpur. Enjoy boating in Kaylana lake and from kaylana go 2 kms above to have a lifetime experience in Bhim Bhadak Cave. Its a military radar area but visitors entry is allowed from 7 to 7.', u'Jodhpur is rich in food and its cultural activities. Do not miss shopping from railway road and Nayi Sadak. You will find some impeccable handicrafts items here and Jooti for which Jodhpur is world famous.', u'If you are in Jodhpur and do not try local food your holiday is of no use.', u"Have Dal Bati, Mirchi Bada, Pyaaj Kachori, Lassi and Shahi samosa. I bet you won't get these anywhere outside the Jodhpur.", u'Visit Shastri Circle at night and enjoy musical fountain there. This place is fabulous. You can have horse riding here. Food is what one can get pretty easily in all its circumference.', u'Janta Sweets, Poker Sweets, Pali Gulab Halwa, Gypsy Restaurant, 15 A. The, Recipe, Tamarind are few of the most trusted eating places in Jodhpur.', u'Jodhpur is well connected from most of the major cities of India. Stay is not a problem here as it has plenty of luxurious resorts, hotels along with hundreds of budget hotels.', u'Best time to visit Jodhpur is November to January as rest of the year summer remains at its peak here.', u'The city of Jodhpur is a famous tourist destination owing to its royal heritage. Places of tourist interest in Jodhpur include clean & massive fortress, striking cenotaphs, and spectacular gardens.', u'If you wish to visit Blue city-Jodhpur I suggest you to visit the place from November to February. The worth place to visit & must try their spicy Golgappa & if money matter not bother you then stay once at Umaid Bhawan to pamper yourself with Royal Rajasthan & their hospitality.', u"Rajasthan is state of many kingdoms. Jodhpur is the one known for its rich styles even today. Remember Jodhpur's jackets and anarkalis. We were excited to shop around after visiting Grand Palace. Gold plated ceilings and unique architecture of the palace is breathtaking. The natural air conditioning through double wall system is amazing. The most fascinating thing for me is bangles of lac customised to my size. My arms full from shoulder to wrist carried complimentary box from the person sitting by the side of fire and doing hard work in the warm afternoon. Lahariya sarees is another attraction. Above all food in desi ghee is yummy. Worth visiting Jodhpur came with me as beautiful memories to cherish for lifetime.", u'Amazing princely city.', u'Places worth visiting are:', u'Mehrangarh Fort and do the zip lining', u'Jaswant Thada', u'Umaid Bhawan palace', u'Sardar market and have the lassi and great place for handicraft shopping', u'Mandore Garden', u'Osian for desert safari', u'If you have some money stay at a heritage or palace hotel. Absolutely worth it.', u'The locals are very friendly and relatively honest. The usual hassles one may get at touristy places like hawkers, beggars, ongoing bargaining, etc. Are relatively non-existent here making the experience even more enjoyable.', u'Our trip to Jodhpur was just random. We took a Volvo bus from Delhi, which took ten hours to reach. Here, I would advice to opt for comfortable bus services like Volvo which you can book online at RSTC website and take a late night bus from either Bikaner House (near India Gate) or you may board the same from IFFCO Chowk. The best part about Rajasthan is that surface transport is pretty well developed and the roads are in really good shape, making your travel a comfortable one.', u'We took an auto from the bus stand to our hotel (The Kothi Heritage). My husband & I was quite clear to move around the city in local transport because we both enjoy doing things locally.', u'During our short stay there, we covered three places- Umaid Bhawan Palace, Jaswant Thada and Mehrangarh Fort.', u"As a tourist, I haven't found it too interesting. Most of the rare & vintage collections have been moved from the museum to the hotel. So, there wasn't much on offer and besides, you could hardly explore a fraction of the hotel. Nevertheless, you can get a glimpse into royal lifestyle of royal family as well as a great collection of vintage clocks. There's a curio shop but the prices they charge are exorbitant. There's also on display collection of vintage cars that date back to the 19th century which the royal family owns. The view from the hilltop in which the Palace is situated is beautiful.", u"We spent the evening exploring the market around the Clock Tower. The Clock Tower is a beautiful piece of architecture and is an easily recognizable city landmark. A staircase leads you to the top floor where it houses the clock. Jodhpur is famous for spices especially Mathania Chillis. So, don't forget to purchase your share of freshly grounded spices and a packet of sun dried Mathania Chillis. Also, jootis for men and women and children are available in variety of colorful embroideries and designs for cheap. So, mochi bazar is a must visit along with Sadar market for a collection of Bandhej and Lahariya scarves and stoles.", u"Next day was meant for Mehrangarh Fort and Jaswant Thada. Mehrangarh Fort is really an architectural marvel. The Jaali-wali Khirkis and large open squares are truly beautiful. And oh boy! The view of the city from the top is priceless. There's a lift service to the top of the fort and I would suggest you to take this as climbing down is much easier than climbing up till the 12th floor!!! The Marwar Region (includes Jodhpur) is famous for miniature paintings. There's a museum that houses such paintings and its a delight to see such beautiful creation. You may shop for knick knacks for your dear ones as there are a couple of shops in the fort which are reasonably priced. One should not miss the house of royal cradles which has a very never-before seen collection. Also, you will be in awe of the period rooms like Phul Mahal, Seesh Mahal and Moti Mahal. We missed out on the aerial zip line activity as we were short in time.", u'We then directly headed to Jawant Thada. You will get an awesome view of the Fort from there. Jaswant thada serves as the burial ground of the Marwar rulers.', u'We then took the train to Jaipur and reached the same night and it took around 4 hours to reach.', u"When in Jodhpur, don't miss to explore the old city on foot. The blue-lime washed houses make for a beautiful background and the narrow alleys have some amazing curio shops. Near the Clock Tower, you will get all sort of Lac bangles and ornaments which makes for beautiful pieces. Also, when you bag is full with goodies but you want to purchase more, don't hesitate to buy the canvas bags that are available near Clock Tower because they make for a great buy and are strong and sturdy and quite spacious!!", u'Also, Jodhpur offers one of the best Kair Sangri and kachori. And lastly, dont forget to buy you share of different papads..', u'Last year I went Jodhpur in winter. Weather was so good in day and evening. Jodhpur was a mix of old and new culture. Old and colourful buildings and roads like Mandor garden, Meharanghar fort, etc. Markets were so beautiful and colourful and full of handmade items. Food and hotels were the best in all over in India. We saw royal culture and Rajput culture very closely. Old nukkads and some tea shops were very famous in Jodhpur. Very spicy food and different in variety. Fast food or snakes culture with Rajasthani touch like mirchi bada, shahi samosa, kedar baati, warwadi rabdi and ice-cream were so good. Very friendly people. This was the best trip of my life. Next time I will go to Jodhpur with my wife.', u"Amazing destination to visit, but don't follow the Google maps, as we were stuck in the old residential area while going to Mehrangadh fort by car. Out of the imagination you can have flashback of lavish lifestyle of Kings, their territory and art. There are few shops at the fort with various art and craft products, you will love to do shopping over there,", u"Folk singers in the fort itself are amazing, Rajasthan's are very much attached to their cultural value, and we went to the fort in Rajasthani attires, we got so much appreciation for that. It was one of the best trip.", u'Jodhpur is one of the most beautiful cities that I have visited. The city is kept clean and its a peaceful place! The city has a great heritage and history. It is easily accessible and is well connected to all major cities in the country through air, rail and road!', u'Jodhpur has a lot of to see and experience. To name a few - Meharangarh fort, Umaid Bhavan Palace museum, Jaswant Thada, Mandore garden, clock tower. Jodhpur offers a great feat to history and art lovers.', u'Jodhpur also is famous for its hospitality and food. The food rich and very tasty especially the ever famous Dal Baati and Churma, various kinds of namkeen and chats and the best of lot - the morchi wadas!! Simply mindblowing!!', u'I recommend that everyone should visit Jodhpur', u"Jodhpur is good city. It is one of the most populated city of Rajasthan. Jodhpur is 2nd biggest city of Rajasthan after Jaipur. Jodhpur known as blue city and sun city also blue city- because most of the house are painted with indigo blue colour. Sun city-It is the place where we can see sun all over the year that's why it is known as sun city. Mehrangarh fort, Jaswant Thada and Umaid Palace are the best attractions of Jodhpur. There are many architectural heritage (Ratan Vilas and Devi Bhawan) in Jodhpur. Both are awesome and it has many historical buildings also. Jodhpur city is like any other 2 tier city and you will have to dig hard to find any glimpse of rich heritage. Except that all the houses and buildings are made of stone and exteriors are almost uniform throughout. Jodhpur sweets are famous in all over india. I likes mishrimal hotels makhania lassi and Jodhpur samosa mirchi vada also. Whenever you visit Jodhpur, don't miss it", u"Except Bishnoi village nothing is there. When you plan for Jodhpur only plan for staying in Baishnoi village and take a Jeep safari of Bishnoi village then you come back. Don't waste time in Jodhpur you may visit Jaisalmer and Udaipur also."]

[u'I had been to Panjim in the month of April 2016. Panaji is a must-visit in the tourism circuit of Goa. The must-visit attractions around Panaji include the Goa state museum, Altinho Hill, Secretariat Buildings and the Municipal Gardens. The Goa state museum has traces of the golden historical era. It has a collection of Hindu and Jan sculpture, bronze collections, furniture and old coins to entice any numismatic fan across the globe. On the hillside above Panaji is the Altinho Hill. The pope stayed here during his visit in 1999. These days, the government offices are located here. The Secretariat is the oldest building in Goa from the colonial times and stands on the site of 15th century Grand summer palace of Yusuf Adil Shah. The Municipal gardens once used to house a bust of Vasco Da Gama when he visited this place in 1498, but later after the region regained independence from foreign rule in 1961, it has a seal of present-day India I. E. The Grand Ashoka Pillar.', u'Excellent place for outstation purpose with family. Beaches are nearby as well as so many casinos are available in Panjim. Spicy food was awesome. Best thing to bus is cashew at very reasonable rate with best quality. Planning in September with family.', u"Excellent place for fun... But costly food near beaches. But OK... Beer and wine is so cheap... We can spend whole day in beach lying on sand, drinking and eating... City buses connecting every place in the city.. With the help of online hotels booking it's very difficult.", u'Wonderful beaches. Good people. Costly in local transit as the cab charges here are almost twice of other places. Hotels are at various prices. Generally Goans fail to give tourist value for their most. Beautiful place indeed.', u'That was the fantastic experience with Panjim, there is no problem with Panjim. Great city, we enjoyed a lot in Panjim, there is cleanliness and people from Panjim are good. They help us a lot, only some of the things are not affordable like cab but a very good city.', u'Goa! Well known for its natural beauty like beaches and other must visit places holds a good hand above all other visiting places in India. Panjim is not only capital city of Goa but it holds major part in sightseeing places. Beaches and local markets are must visit places. There are number of Casinos available if people are interested but it is costly. Seafood is awesome and in that I liked the taste of Crabs very much. In some beaches you can try activities like water rides, para sailing etc. Taking a train is the best choice if your from India itself.', u'Goa is place for young people. You can visit with family. As couple or friends or in a group too. If you love to watch beaches. I personally prefer north Goa specially for youngsters. Overall if we see south Goa was also good. I want to visit Goa may be next year. It was relaxing for both of us.', u'Panjim is a centre of Goa, with all the boat cruises activities here. From here you can go to south and north Goa and depending on the place you like you can choose your next course of action. Like and it was an nice experience here it was a memorable tour of my life and I want to visit again here in future.', u'Panjim is capital of Goa. Goa is a very nice place, its attraction is clear and calm beaches. Hungama of Tito lane, people are very friendly. Old Goa one can see the Portuguese remains. Nightclub and casino are also place to enjoy. Stay is a bit costly. Vegetarian foods are not very common.', u'This city is hub of Goa. For all those wanting to try their luck at casino should visit cruise ship docked at Panjim in the Mandovi river. This city has some of the finest hotels such as Fidalgo, Welcome Heritage Inn, Rajdhani, Arcadia, Sunrise and Keni. Apart from the staple Goan delicacies, this place also has many Chinese, Punjabi and pure veg restaurants. Ritz, one of the most famous restaurant in Panjim serves quality food and is not at all costly. Miramar beach lies just 10mins from Panjim city. To enjoy traditional dances, one can visit Santa Monica cruise which allows you to enjoy traditional Goan folk dances with drinks and food.']

[u"It's a nice little hillside town, full of satpura forest and mountain all round. It's worth visiting for caves, natural fountains, forestry area, animals, old Lord Shiva temple.", u'The resorts are worth enjoying.', u'The people are lovely.', u'Well connected by road from Bhopal.', u'We travelled Pachmarhi in march end for a 3 day, 2 night expedition. We precooked our stay in MP tourism resorts as it was a long weekend and peek time. (Precooking at the local MP tourism office can give you extra 10% discount). Our journey started from pipariya Railway stn .. Had some tea and poha - jalebi at the stn. Which still tempts my taste buds. Hired a cab from there (no need to prebook )towards Pachmarhi. The early morning ride was fabulous through the hills, the greenery, the fresh air and above all the excitement to reach the place we had so much heard of.', u"We checked in at Hotel Highland for our 1st day stay. It's located right at the entrance of the city near to the taxi stand. It's a nice budget property with plenty of greenery and lots of activity for children. The food at the hotel is OK types. There's a very stylish bus which starts from this hotel for city tour, though it's always advisable to hire your personal cab.", u'1st day - we covered the non forest spots of Pachmarhi, namely the Jatashankar, the Bada and chota Mahadev, Handi kho, priyadarshini point, green valley, rajendra giri sunset pont. Among these we really loved the Jatashankar and Bada Mahadev for the beautiful trek through the caves and their mythological significance. Lots of ayurvedic stuff are sold at Jatashankar which can arguably cure all your medical ailments. The 1st day tour was both enthralling and tiring as there was a bit of trek at virtually all the spots.', u"2nd day- we checked in to hotel Champak bunglow which is probably the best stay at Pachmarhi. It is located in the cantt. Region near the forest zone. We decided to cover the forest zone spots in our 2nd day. After taking necessary permit, we moved straight to the Bees Fall. There's quite a bit of trek to reach the fall, but the sheer beauty of the place and the refreshing dip in the waterfall, with a little rain in the air took all our tiredness away.", u'After having lunch and little rest we ventured for paragliding, saw pandav caves, reechgarh, champak lake and then back to hotel as it started raining heavily.', u"3rd day - we just relaxed at the resort and enjoyed it's ambience, greenery, pool, and sumptuous food. Above all we recharged our energy batteries which were so very much drained during our 1st 2 days.", u"There are many more spots in Pachmarhi which we couldn't cover due to scarcity of time and energy - duchess fall, apsara fall, Rajat pratap, dhoopgarh, chauragarh to name a few.", u'We left the hotel for our evening train with happy memories and a desire to come back again to see the remaining spots.', u'Pachmarhi is nice place to visit specially in rainy season. Cloud looks like they are kissing you, playing with you.', u'I visited after long. Most of the places are well developed.', u'Bee fall is just excellent. One can get relaxed here. Still need more facilities like wash room and change room for ladies ..', u'Sunset at Dhoopgarh is awesome.', u'Chouragarh, you can never forget.', u'Botanical garden is nice place. Deheliyas are very big in size and blossom with full size.', u'There are monopoly of drivers association. Their charges are very high. It should be reasonable. Most of the place you can visit with your own vehicle except Bee fall.', u'Everyone must visit Pachmarhi once.', u"Totally natural remorse, waterfall bade Mahadev hills and hotel you will get everywhere. Pachmarhi totally depend on tourist place, little expensive but it's part of every tourist place. You should go over there but before going select good hotel and service is so poor in some hotel so be careful.", u'The place is almost good. But makes us tired because for every sightseeing, we have to walk for 2 to 4 km. Chauragarh is a must visit place. Other people who are coming from its peak point will say that it is the worst. But when you will go on the peak, you will say only one word - Amazing.', u'Bee fall to pandav caves and from Temple to lush green land and most important waterfalls.', u'One of my favorite place to plan 2-3 days weekend trip.', u'Most of the luxury and best hotels are under MP Tourism one of favourite is HOTEL GLEN VIEW so it is advisable to book the hotel priorly otherwise you have to roam everywhere for the hotel room.', u'Recently visited Pachmarhi, only hill station in Madhya Pradesh. Main attraction of this hill station is that it is completely natural. Local authorities have not touched or alter its natural beauty either its caves or waterfalls. You have to trek to reach all its waterfalls as there is no shortcuts or roads have been made by authorities like they did in every other hill stations. Here you will find yourself in the lap of nature with low network in your phone. ;)', u'Famous places of pachmarhi includes Jatashankar temple, Pandav Caves, Rajat Prapat, Bee fall, Handi khoh, Apsara Vihar, Reechgarh, Bade Mahadev, Chauragarh, Dhupgarh. You have to take local jeeps to access all these places along with forest guide. We had been there for 2 days so could not cover all sightseeings. Make plan for at least 3-4 days to cover all places. Remember you have to trek to reach these places.', u'It is a small hill station with small market. Not so good for shopping but food is good.', u'We Tried to cover as much places as possible so it was hectic. We did trekking, took bath under bee fall (best experience of Pachmarhi), stroll around the streets.', u'Best season to visit Pachmarhi is between July to October. You will only see greenery but can not bath or go near falls as it is not permissible during monsoon. So plan your tour according to your choice.', u'Good hill station to visit. Good atmosphere. Climate was little hot between 11am to 4 pm. Good sightseeing spots. Roads were bumpy at approaching spots. You feel uneven road on your spine while travelling in gypsy which is mandatory to hire. Govt needs to improve approach road condition to sightseeing spots. Also need to remake steps at all spots which are in most pathetic condition. Will avoid spot accidents for elders where there is no hospital for treatment. Also sign boards are very rare, need more especially while on tracking. Overall good place to enjoy fully if infrastructure improves. M. P. Govt needs to make plan to improve infrastructure, make budget and spend to improve. Today they are bit passive. Time has changed.', u'Pachmarhi is a good place if you are looking to go to a less crowded destination. It is the only hill station of Madhya Pradesh.', u'We drove down from Nagpur. The drive was a comfortable 5 hour without much traffic. Pachmarhi is a cantonment town and well connected from Bhopal also.', u'We visited around mid June when the climate was beautiful - it was raining with a lot of greenery around. Some of the major tourist attractions are the Pandav Caves (believed to be built by the Pandavas during their exile), Jatashankar and Mahadeo caves and the Bee Fall.', u'The view from the Pandav Caves (from where the place derived its name) and the Sunset point are great. Bee Fall is a steep walk down a lot of steps, so be ware if you are travelling with kids.', u"Overall, its a secluded and peaceful town amid nature if that's the kind of vacation you are looking away from the hustle bustle of noisy destinations.", u'Pachmarhi is good place for a summer holiday. In the month of March it has a good greenery everywhere. It is a good place to relax your body. No pollution no noise. And it has so many waterfalls. There are good communication facility from Bhopal & Indore. Even it has good road connectivity. But if you are going with your own vehicle you have park it in your hotel. As in Pachmarhi you have to use the 4*4 vehicle to see the spots. There is local 4*4 gypsy available there in Pachmarhi. At very affordable cost.']

[u'It was my first trip to Udaipur. Udaipur is very nice place to spent your quality time with your family. You can find everything there like palace, lake, sunset view, mountain view, wild life, shopping and special the pride of Rajasthan Folk Dance. There are few good kind of restaurant which serves a lot of delicious food. Uber made travelling very easy.', u'Udaipur is historic city but very costly for tourist.', u'Like city palace entry cost 280 per head, Camera fee 250, Even parking fee is 150 rs. What is that for. Just to give money to Mewar maharajas for doing nothing.', u'Every other sightseeing place has some or other type of entry fee.', u"One can't say that to maintain fees are needed. Take examples of Kankaria lake Ahmedabad where nominal charges are there yet perfectly managed. Sayaji garden, Baroda. Where no entry charge and perfectly maintained.", u"It's just because of foreign visitors crowd all things are getting high enough. Local tourist should not charge more.", u'Other than city palace nothing is worth watchin or out of pocket for common people. Like crystal galarry yentry fee 550 per head. Boat ride 700 per head.', u'Very costly for common people.', u'Location difficult to access with 4-wheeler,', u'All rooms are on 1st floor & above ... But there is no lift and there is nobody to carry luggage to the room,', u'Poor water connection and minimum amenities not provided in the bathroom,', u'No phone to call even the reception,', u'No TV.', u"I must admit that my trip to Udaipur has been one of the most cherished. I can't help it but I get hell bent on making people go there if they haven't and trust me once back from there, they feel & do the same.", u'Maybe my love for it is because of the forts and palaces, the rich heritage and so many things to see and explore. All in all a grand wholesome package.', u'Four full days are good enough to see most of the places and some famous places around it. So, here is what all you can do in this trip:', u'1. Forts - Chittorgarh Fort, Kumbhalgarh Fort', u'2. Palaces - City Palace, Jag Mandir Palace', u'3. The Royal Vintage Car Collection Display', u'4. Temples/Mandir - Jagdish (Vishnu) Mandir, Eklingji, Ranakpur Temple, Saas Bahu Mandir', u'5. Lakes - Pichola, Fateh Sagar', u'6. Maharana Pratap Memorial, Ropeway to the highest point of Udaipur, Saheliyon ki Baari', u'7. Walk down the lanes of the city to enjoy their culture, food and art.', u'Quite an interesting listing! If you have not been there you know where to head next.', u'Udaipur is a nice and lovely place in South of Rajasthan and having great things to watch and to do also..', u'Well I went along with my 4 friends from New Delhi using train and stayed at Hotel Savera near Railway station. Hotel is nice and good clean rooms. Cooperative staff and FO Mr. Vikas Owner.. Food was nice and reasonable.', u'Near by market was good and cheap with great variety of food and other things to purchase.', u"We travelled to lot of places in Udaipur including Famous Haldighati and Nathdwara Temple & Eklingji Temple all in 1200 bucks for 7 seater bolero, it's all for one day.", u'Local sightseeing was good including Saheli ki bari, City Palace, Maharana Pratap museum and statue was just amazing. View from the top was lovely from Maharana Pratap Statue... Few more places also all in 650 bucks for whole day.', u'Trip was lovely with great Rajasthani food including Dal baati.', u'Costs around 12500 bucks for 5 people including food, travel, hotel and vehicle for sightseeing in Udaipur...', u'Possitive points are staff is very cooperative helpful service is excelant. Improvement require in logistic and food charges. Resort is byond city boundary and normal taxi charges are exorbitant. Uber do not serve. And mangment outsourced transort who charge very high. This need to correct else members wll not recomand this resort.', u'I planned for a day trip of it and took a bus for the sightseeing. It was Rishabh travels of Udaipur and they charge around 300 for a day tour.', u'The nicest place to see in Udaipur is the City Palace and I would recommend to spent at-least 2-3 hours in that place. You can go for boating in the backyard of that place and I bet you will enjoy that ride and the view more than anyone else.', u'Udaipur is one of the most beautiful cities of India. We have gone to Udaipur for 2 nights 3 days', u'Here can be the suggested plan', u'1 day one- land at Udaipur by 11am and after quick hotel check-in, you can plan to visit Kumbhalgarh and Haldighati area or you can go to Nathdwara if you want add religious element in the trip. Return to hotel by 8pm and can plan to have dinner in the hotel. Book a table on the rooftop or lakeside restaurant, if the hotel is near lake', u'Day 2- local city visit', u'Start your day early and go to monsoon palace fr 30 minutes then city palace for 2 hrs with guide. Lunch at Natraj restaurant is must. Post lunch proceed to see vintage car meuseum and then you can spend lot of time boating, joying lake view, visiting jag mandir, gardens etc', u'You can quickly visit local shopping market while returning back to hotel. Or can visit bagor ko haveli in the evening to enjoy local music and dance program of 1 hr', u'Book a table near lake side at the ambrai restaurant for dinner. I will give this place 5 out of 5. And a must visit place', u'One can skip the following in udaipur- saheliyon ki baadi, doodh talai, sukhadiya circle etc', u'Day 3- checkout from hotel and proceed to hotel', u"Udaipur in monsoon is simply superb with greenery all around and lakes full. There are so many places of interest to visit. City has so much to offer in the form of architecture, art and culture that keeps one totally engrossed and busy. Travel to Mt Abu through picturesque lush green mountains can be another wonderful experience. Udaipur is truly a city of lakes. During monsoons it's beauty of lakes can be best experienced.", u"Nice time in Udaipur. Great scenic beauty. I actually liked the foreign market and the cafe's over there. Reasonable food, walking distance to most of the sightseeing from there. Also I like the zoo and the Monsoon palace at the hill top. Must see the cultural programme at Bagore ki Haveli from 7 to 8 evening. City palace is very well maintained loved watching the palace. Vintage car museum has a great collection but less in number and it's quite expensive 250 per person. But I would say go for it. We stayed at hotel Rampratap palace and it was a great decision. Loved the lake view from hotel. So overall we had fun. To all travellers just one thing if your going to stay in Udaipur don't stay in a hotel instead stay in a resort near lakes and mountains. Also stay in a resort which looks like a palace. It will be fun. You have great option over there.", u'Enjoy. Still miles to go !!!']

[u'Jodhpur, a city of culture and heritage, is one of the astounding cities in the India.', u'Known as Bluecity and Suncity, Jodhpur has its own built legacy of historic monuments. This review has been long overdue but as they say, "Its better late than never"', u'It is covered from hills and rocks from all four directions and its main charm is you can have everything here. From lip smacking food to adventurous tasks, from peaceful stay to wild long drives, Jodhpur has all.', u'Now come to the places one must not skip. Mehrangarh Fort, Umaid Palace, Mandore Garden, Tripoliya Market, Kaylana Lake are some of the main tourists attractions. The Mehrangarh Fort, with its beauty, is the living proof of the hard work and skill of the Jodhpuri sculptors. Take a look of Museum in fort and you will love it. It is beautifully laid out. It has a palanquin section where you can see a wide collection of old royal palanquins. The heritage of the Rathores, including arms, costumes, paintings, decorated period rooms, etc, is exhibited in the museum. The museum gives us an idea of the grandeur of the royal families of the past.', u'One can have beautiful view of BLUE CITY from top of the fort. Jasvant Thada is again a must visit. It is very nearly situated to the Fort.', u'Ganesh Mandir, Pal Balaji, Samrat Ashok Garden, Masuria Pahadi, Bhim Bhadak Cave, Siddhnath Shiv Temple, Ranchordas ji Temple are some fantastic places one must explore in Jodhpur. Enjoy boating in Kaylana lake and from kaylana go 2 kms above to have a lifetime experience in Bhim Bhadak Cave. Its a military radar area but visitors entry is allowed from 7 to 7.', u'Jodhpur is rich in food and its cultural activities. Do not miss shopping from railway road and Nayi Sadak. You will find some impeccable handicrafts items here and Jooti for which Jodhpur is world famous.', u'If you are in Jodhpur and do not try local food your holiday is of no use.', u"Have Dal Bati, Mirchi Bada, Pyaaj Kachori, Lassi and Shahi samosa. I bet you won't get these anywhere outside the Jodhpur.", u'Visit Shastri Circle at night and enjoy musical fountain there. This place is fabulous. You can have horse riding here. Food is what one can get pretty easily in all its circumference.', u'Janta Sweets, Poker Sweets, Pali Gulab Halwa, Gypsy Restaurant, 15 A. The, Recipe, Tamarind are few of the most trusted eating places in Jodhpur.', u'Jodhpur is well connected from most of the major cities of India. Stay is not a problem here as it has plenty of luxurious resorts, hotels along with hundreds of budget hotels.', u'Best time to visit Jodhpur is November to January as rest of the year summer remains at its peak here.', u'The city of Jodhpur is a famous tourist destination owing to its royal heritage. Places of tourist interest in Jodhpur include clean & massive fortress, striking cenotaphs, and spectacular gardens.', u'If you wish to visit Blue city-Jodhpur I suggest you to visit the place from November to February. The worth place to visit & must try their spicy Golgappa & if money matter not bother you then stay once at Umaid Bhawan to pamper yourself with Royal Rajasthan & their hospitality.', u"Rajasthan is state of many kingdoms. Jodhpur is the one known for its rich styles even today. Remember Jodhpur's jackets and anarkalis. We were excited to shop around after visiting Grand Palace. Gold plated ceilings and unique architecture of the palace is breathtaking. The natural air conditioning through double wall system is amazing. The most fascinating thing for me is bangles of lac customised to my size. My arms full from shoulder to wrist carried complimentary box from the person sitting by the side of fire and doing hard work in the warm afternoon. Lahariya sarees is another attraction. Above all food in desi ghee is yummy. Worth visiting Jodhpur came with me as beautiful memories to cherish for lifetime.", u'Amazing princely city.', u'Places worth visiting are:', u'Mehrangarh Fort and do the zip lining', u'Jaswant Thada', u'Umaid Bhawan palace', u'Sardar market and have the lassi and great place for handicraft shopping', u'Mandore Garden', u'Osian for desert safari', u'If you have some money stay at a heritage or palace hotel. Absolutely worth it.', u'The locals are very friendly and relatively honest. The usual hassles one may get at touristy places like hawkers, beggars, ongoing bargaining, etc. Are relatively non-existent here making the experience even more enjoyable.', u'Our trip to Jodhpur was just random. We took a Volvo bus from Delhi, which took ten hours to reach. Here, I would advice to opt for comfortable bus services like Volvo which you can book online at RSTC website and take a late night bus from either Bikaner House (near India Gate) or you may board the same from IFFCO Chowk. The best part about Rajasthan is that surface transport is pretty well developed and the roads are in really good shape, making your travel a comfortable one.', u'We took an auto from the bus stand to our hotel (The Kothi Heritage). My husband & I was quite clear to move around the city in local transport because we both enjoy doing things locally.', u'During our short stay there, we covered three places- Umaid Bhawan Palace, Jaswant Thada and Mehrangarh Fort.', u"As a tourist, I haven't found it too interesting. Most of the rare & vintage collections have been moved from the museum to the hotel. So, there wasn't much on offer and besides, you could hardly explore a fraction of the hotel. Nevertheless, you can get a glimpse into royal lifestyle of royal family as well as a great collection of vintage clocks. There's a curio shop but the prices they charge are exorbitant. There's also on display collection of vintage cars that date back to the 19th century which the royal family owns. The view from the hilltop in which the Palace is situated is beautiful.", u"We spent the evening exploring the market around the Clock Tower. The Clock Tower is a beautiful piece of architecture and is an easily recognizable city landmark. A staircase leads you to the top floor where it houses the clock. Jodhpur is famous for spices especially Mathania Chillis. So, don't forget to purchase your share of freshly grounded spices and a packet of sun dried Mathania Chillis. Also, jootis for men and women and children are available in variety of colorful embroideries and designs for cheap. So, mochi bazar is a must visit along with Sadar market for a collection of Bandhej and Lahariya scarves and stoles.", u"Next day was meant for Mehrangarh Fort and Jaswant Thada. Mehrangarh Fort is really an architectural marvel. The Jaali-wali Khirkis and large open squares are truly beautiful. And oh boy! The view of the city from the top is priceless. There's a lift service to the top of the fort and I would suggest you to take this as climbing down is much easier than climbing up till the 12th floor!!! The Marwar Region (includes Jodhpur) is famous for miniature paintings. There's a museum that houses such paintings and its a delight to see such beautiful creation. You may shop for knick knacks for your dear ones as there are a couple of shops in the fort which are reasonably priced. One should not miss the house of royal cradles which has a very never-before seen collection. Also, you will be in awe of the period rooms like Phul Mahal, Seesh Mahal and Moti Mahal. We missed out on the aerial zip line activity as we were short in time.", u'We then directly headed to Jawant Thada. You will get an awesome view of the Fort from there. Jaswant thada serves as the burial ground of the Marwar rulers.', u'We then took the train to Jaipur and reached the same night and it took around 4 hours to reach.', u"When in Jodhpur, don't miss to explore the old city on foot. The blue-lime washed houses make for a beautiful background and the narrow alleys have some amazing curio shops. Near the Clock Tower, you will get all sort of Lac bangles and ornaments which makes for beautiful pieces. Also, when you bag is full with goodies but you want to purchase more, don't hesitate to buy the canvas bags that are available near Clock Tower because they make for a great buy and are strong and sturdy and quite spacious!!", u'Also, Jodhpur offers one of the best Kair Sangri and kachori. And lastly, dont forget to buy you share of different papads..', u'Last year I went Jodhpur in winter. Weather was so good in day and evening. Jodhpur was a mix of old and new culture. Old and colourful buildings and roads like Mandor garden, Meharanghar fort, etc. Markets were so beautiful and colourful and full of handmade items. Food and hotels were the best in all over in India. We saw royal culture and Rajput culture very closely. Old nukkads and some tea shops were very famous in Jodhpur. Very spicy food and different in variety. Fast food or snakes culture with Rajasthani touch like mirchi bada, shahi samosa, kedar baati, warwadi rabdi and ice-cream were so good. Very friendly people. This was the best trip of my life. Next time I will go to Jodhpur with my wife.', u"Amazing destination to visit, but don't follow the Google maps, as we were stuck in the old residential area while going to Mehrangadh fort by car. Out of the imagination you can have flashback of lavish lifestyle of Kings, their territory and art. There are few shops at the fort with various art and craft products, you will love to do shopping over there,", u"Folk singers in the fort itself are amazing, Rajasthan's are very much attached to their cultural value, and we went to the fort in Rajasthani attires, we got so much appreciation for that. It was one of the best trip.", u'Jodhpur is one of the most beautiful cities that I have visited. The city is kept clean and its a peaceful place! The city has a great heritage and history. It is easily accessible and is well connected to all major cities in the country through air, rail and road!', u'Jodhpur has a lot of to see and experience. To name a few - Meharangarh fort, Umaid Bhavan Palace museum, Jaswant Thada, Mandore garden, clock tower. Jodhpur offers a great feat to history and art lovers.', u'Jodhpur also is famous for its hospitality and food. The food rich and very tasty especially the ever famous Dal Baati and Churma, various kinds of namkeen and chats and the best of lot - the morchi wadas!! Simply mindblowing!!', u'I recommend that everyone should visit Jodhpur', u"Jodhpur is good city. It is one of the most populated city of Rajasthan. Jodhpur is 2nd biggest city of Rajasthan after Jaipur. Jodhpur known as blue city and sun city also blue city- because most of the house are painted with indigo blue colour. Sun city-It is the place where we can see sun all over the year that's why it is known as sun city. Mehrangarh fort, Jaswant Thada and Umaid Palace are the best attractions of Jodhpur. There are many architectural heritage (Ratan Vilas and Devi Bhawan) in Jodhpur. Both are awesome and it has many historical buildings also. Jodhpur city is like any other 2 tier city and you will have to dig hard to find any glimpse of rich heritage. Except that all the houses and buildings are made of stone and exteriors are almost uniform throughout. Jodhpur sweets are famous in all over india. I likes mishrimal hotels makhania lassi and Jodhpur samosa mirchi vada also. Whenever you visit Jodhpur, don't miss it", u"Except Bishnoi village nothing is there. When you plan for Jodhpur only plan for staying in Baishnoi village and take a Jeep safari of Bishnoi village then you come back. Don't waste time in Jodhpur you may visit Jaisalmer and Udaipur also."]

[u'I had been to Panjim in the month of April 2016. Panaji is a must-visit in the tourism circuit of Goa. The must-visit attractions around Panaji include the Goa state museum, Altinho Hill, Secretariat Buildings and the Municipal Gardens. The Goa state museum has traces of the golden historical era. It has a collection of Hindu and Jan sculpture, bronze collections, furniture and old coins to entice any numismatic fan across the globe. On the hillside above Panaji is the Altinho Hill. The pope stayed here during his visit in 1999. These days, the government offices are located here. The Secretariat is the oldest building in Goa from the colonial times and stands on the site of 15th century Grand summer palace of Yusuf Adil Shah. The Municipal gardens once used to house a bust of Vasco Da Gama when he visited this place in 1498, but later after the region regained independence from foreign rule in 1961, it has a seal of present-day India I. E. The Grand Ashoka Pillar.', u'Excellent place for outstation purpose with family. Beaches are nearby as well as so many casinos are available in Panjim. Spicy food was awesome. Best thing to bus is cashew at very reasonable rate with best quality. Planning in September with family.', u"Excellent place for fun... But costly food near beaches. But OK... Beer and wine is so cheap... We can spend whole day in beach lying on sand, drinking and eating... City buses connecting every place in the city.. With the help of online hotels booking it's very difficult.", u'Wonderful beaches. Good people. Costly in local transit as the cab charges here are almost twice of other places. Hotels are at various prices. Generally Goans fail to give tourist value for their most. Beautiful place indeed.', u'That was the fantastic experience with Panjim, there is no problem with Panjim. Great city, we enjoyed a lot in Panjim, there is cleanliness and people from Panjim are good. They help us a lot, only some of the things are not affordable like cab but a very good city.', u'Goa! Well known for its natural beauty like beaches and other must visit places holds a good hand above all other visiting places in India. Panjim is not only capital city of Goa but it holds major part in sightseeing places. Beaches and local markets are must visit places. There are number of Casinos available if people are interested but it is costly. Seafood is awesome and in that I liked the taste of Crabs very much. In some beaches you can try activities like water rides, para sailing etc. Taking a train is the best choice if your from India itself.', u'Goa is place for young people. You can visit with family. As couple or friends or in a group too. If you love to watch beaches. I personally prefer north Goa specially for youngsters. Overall if we see south Goa was also good. I want to visit Goa may be next year. It was relaxing for both of us.', u'Panjim is a centre of Goa, with all the boat cruises activities here. From here you can go to south and north Goa and depending on the place you like you can choose your next course of action. Like and it was an nice experience here it was a memorable tour of my life and I want to visit again here in future.', u'Panjim is capital of Goa. Goa is a very nice place, its attraction is clear and calm beaches. Hungama of Tito lane, people are very friendly. Old Goa one can see the Portuguese remains. Nightclub and casino are also place to enjoy. Stay is a bit costly. Vegetarian foods are not very common.', u'This city is hub of Goa. For all those wanting to try their luck at casino should visit cruise ship docked at Panjim in the Mandovi river. This city has some of the finest hotels such as Fidalgo, Welcome Heritage Inn, Rajdhani, Arcadia, Sunrise and Keni. Apart from the staple Goan delicacies, this place also has many Chinese, Punjabi and pure veg restaurants. Ritz, one of the most famous restaurant in Panjim serves quality food and is not at all costly. Miramar beach lies just 10mins from Panjim city. To enjoy traditional dances, one can visit Santa Monica cruise which allows you to enjoy traditional Goan folk dances with drinks and food.']

Life saving guards are always keeping a close eyes on the people trying to get deep in side the sea and suggesting not to go beyond a define line.

The calangute market is very famous. You get good cashewnuts and Bibinca here. The beach is very crowded and if you are looking for relaxation or want to spend some quality time with your wife or girlfriend, skip this beach. Having said that, if you are here with your family, then kids will surely enjoy. There are quite a few water sports which you can do. But you will have to do some very good bargaining. There are a few very good seafood restaurants in and around Calangute.']

[u"It's a nice little hillside town, full of satpura forest and mountain all round. It's worth visiting for caves, natural fountains, forestry area, animals, old Lord Shiva temple.", u'The resorts are worth enjoying.', u'The people are lovely.', u'Well connected by road from Bhopal.', u'We travelled Pachmarhi in march end for a 3 day, 2 night expedition. We precooked our stay in MP tourism resorts as it was a long weekend and peek time. (Precooking at the local MP tourism office can give you extra 10% discount). Our journey started from pipariya Railway stn .. Had some tea and poha - jalebi at the stn. Which still tempts my taste buds. Hired a cab from there (no need to prebook )towards Pachmarhi. The early morning ride was fabulous through the hills, the greenery, the fresh air and above all the excitement to reach the place we had so much heard of.', u"We checked in at Hotel Highland for our 1st day stay. It's located right at the entrance of the city near to the taxi stand. It's a nice budget property with plenty of greenery and lots of activity for children. The food at the hotel is OK types. There's a very stylish bus which starts from this hotel for city tour, though it's always advisable to hire your personal cab.", u'1st day - we covered the non forest spots of Pachmarhi, namely the Jatashankar, the Bada and chota Mahadev, Handi kho, priyadarshini point, green valley, rajendra giri sunset pont. Among these we really loved the Jatashankar and Bada Mahadev for the beautiful trek through the caves and their mythological significance. Lots of ayurvedic stuff are sold at Jatashankar which can arguably cure all your medical ailments. The 1st day tour was both enthralling and tiring as there was a bit of trek at virtually all the spots.', u"2nd day- we checked in to hotel Champak bunglow which is probably the best stay at Pachmarhi. It is located in the cantt. Region near the forest zone. We decided to cover the forest zone spots in our 2nd day. After taking necessary permit, we moved straight to the Bees Fall. There's quite a bit of trek to reach the fall, but the sheer beauty of the place and the refreshing dip in the waterfall, with a little rain in the air took all our tiredness away.", u'After having lunch and little rest we ventured for paragliding, saw pandav caves, reechgarh, champak lake and then back to hotel as it started raining heavily.', u"3rd day - we just relaxed at the resort and enjoyed it's ambience, greenery, pool, and sumptuous food. Above all we recharged our energy batteries which were so very much drained during our 1st 2 days.", u"There are many more spots in Pachmarhi which we couldn't cover due to scarcity of time and energy - duchess fall, apsara fall, Rajat pratap, dhoopgarh, chauragarh to name a few.", u'We left the hotel for our evening train with happy memories and a desire to come back again to see the remaining spots.', u'Pachmarhi is nice place to visit specially in rainy season. Cloud looks like they are kissing you, playing with you.', u'I visited after long. Most of the places are well developed.', u'Bee fall is just excellent. One can get relaxed here. Still need more facilities like wash room and change room for ladies ..', u'Sunset at Dhoopgarh is awesome.', u'Chouragarh, you can never forget.', u'Botanical garden is nice place. Deheliyas are very big in size and blossom with full size.', u'There are monopoly of drivers association. Their charges are very high. It should be reasonable. Most of the place you can visit with your own vehicle except Bee fall.', u'Everyone must visit Pachmarhi once.', u"Totally natural remorse, waterfall bade Mahadev hills and hotel you will get everywhere. Pachmarhi totally depend on tourist place, little expensive but it's part of every tourist place. You should go over there but before going select good hotel and service is so poor in some hotel so be careful.", u'The place is almost good. But makes us tired because for every sightseeing, we have to walk for 2 to 4 km. Chauragarh is a must visit place. Other people who are coming from its peak point will say that it is the worst. But when you will go on the peak, you will say only one word - Amazing.', u'Bee fall to pandav caves and from Temple to lush green land and most important waterfalls.', u'One of my favorite place to plan 2-3 days weekend trip.', u'Most of the luxury and best hotels are under MP Tourism one of favourite is HOTEL GLEN VIEW so it is advisable to book the hotel priorly otherwise you have to roam everywhere for the hotel room.', u'Recently visited Pachmarhi, only hill station in Madhya Pradesh. Main attraction of this hill station is that it is completely natural. Local authorities have not touched or alter its natural beauty either its caves or waterfalls. You have to trek to reach all its waterfalls as there is no shortcuts or roads have been made by authorities like they did in every other hill stations. Here you will find yourself in the lap of nature with low network in your phone. ;)', u'Famous places of pachmarhi includes Jatashankar temple, Pandav Caves, Rajat Prapat, Bee fall, Handi khoh, Apsara Vihar, Reechgarh, Bade Mahadev, Chauragarh, Dhupgarh. You have to take local jeeps to access all these places along with forest guide. We had been there for 2 days so could not cover all sightseeings. Make plan for at least 3-4 days to cover all places. Remember you have to trek to reach these places.', u'It is a small hill station with small market. Not so good for shopping but food is good.', u'We Tried to cover as much places as possible so it was hectic. We did trekking, took bath under bee fall (best experience of Pachmarhi), stroll around the streets.', u'Best season to visit Pachmarhi is between July to October. You will only see greenery but can not bath or go near falls as it is not permissible during monsoon. So plan your tour according to your choice.', u'Good hill station to visit. Good atmosphere. Climate was little hot between 11am to 4 pm. Good sightseeing spots. Roads were bumpy at approaching spots. You feel uneven road on your spine while travelling in gypsy which is mandatory to hire. Govt needs to improve approach road condition to sightseeing spots. Also need to remake steps at all spots which are in most pathetic condition. Will avoid spot accidents for elders where there is no hospital for treatment. Also sign boards are very rare, need more especially while on tracking. Overall good place to enjoy fully if infrastructure improves. M. P. Govt needs to make plan to improve infrastructure, make budget and spend to improve. Today they are bit passive. Time has changed.', u'Pachmarhi is a good place if you are looking to go to a less crowded destination. It is the only hill station of Madhya Pradesh.', u'We drove down from Nagpur. The drive was a comfortable 5 hour without much traffic. Pachmarhi is a cantonment town and well connected from Bhopal also.', u'We visited around mid June when the climate was beautiful - it was raining with a lot of greenery around. Some of the major tourist attractions are the Pandav Caves (believed to be built by the Pandavas during their exile), Jatashankar and Mahadeo caves and the Bee Fall.', u'The view from the Pandav Caves (from where the place derived its name) and the Sunset point are great. Bee Fall is a steep walk down a lot of steps, so be ware if you are travelling with kids.', u"Overall, its a secluded and peaceful town amid nature if that's the kind of vacation you are looking away from the hustle bustle of noisy destinations.", u'Pachmarhi is good place for a summer holiday. In the month of March it has a good greenery everywhere. It is a good place to relax your body. No pollution no noise. And it has so many waterfalls. There are good communication facility from Bhopal & Indore. Even it has good road connectivity. But if you are going with your own vehicle you have park it in your hotel. As in Pachmarhi you have to use the 4*4 vehicle to see the spots. There is local 4*4 gypsy available there in Pachmarhi. At very affordable cost.']

Madhya Pradesh
, situated in the centre of 
India
, is often called the heart of 
India
. It is surrounded by 
Uttar Pradesh
, 
Chhattisgarh
, 
Maharashtra
, 
Gujarat
 and 
Rajasthan
. The state has two hill ranges Vindhya and Satpura that have traditionally served as boundary markers between north and south 
India
. It also has a number of rivers, such as 
Narmada
, Tapti, Chambal, Betwa, Ken, which make it agriculturally fertile. 
Narmada
, which runs between the two hill ranges, is the most important river and is worshipped locally as a goddess.
These natural features have created a landscape of plateaus, river valleys, hills, and forests, but mostly the state can be seen as plateau land with low hills. The weather is largely warm and dry, and almost unbearably hot during summers. MP is a primarily rural and its largely tribal economy runs on agriculture and forest-produce; but there are also urban centres such as 
Bhopal
, 
Indore
 and 
Gwalior
. These cities, in addition to 
Khajuraho
 and 
Jabalpur
, have domestic airports.
For the visitor, this large state can be understood in four parts: central, with 
Bhopal
 town as the base; northern, with 
Gwalior
 
as base; eastern with 
Jabalpur
 
as base; and western, with 
Indore
 as base. Madhya Pradesh has three UNESCO World Heritage Sites: the 9th-10th century temples at 
Khajuraho
 known for their erotic carvings (reachable from 
Gwalior
); remains of the 3rdcentury BC - 7thcentury AD Buddhist settlement at 
Sanchi
; and cave paintings dating to 8000 BC at 
Bhimbetka
 (both reachable from 
Bhopal
). 
The capital, 
Bhopal
 is a former princely state, a small city celebrated for its mosques and palaces, old-town ambience, and refined Urdu language. The hill-citadel of 
Mandu
 (near 
Indore
) is renowned for its ruins set in greenery, especially after monsoons. 
Ujjain
 is a holy city for the Hindus and hosts the Kumbh Mela, attracting millions of pilgrims, every 12 years. 
The scenic sanctuaries of 
Kanha
 (the setting for Rudyard Kipling's Jungle Book) and 
Bandhavgarh National Parks
 are mostly savannah grassland terrains that have tigers and elephants as prime attractions. These are reachable from 
Jabalpur
. 
Rajasthan
 is 
India
's largest state, located on its north-western border with 
Pakistan
. It is surrounded by the states of 
Gujarat
, 
Uttar Pradesh
, 
Madhya Pradesh
, 
Haryana
 and 
Punjab
. Rajasthan is bisected by the Aravalli hills, dividing it into two distinct landscapes. On the west is Rajasthan's unique feature, the 
Thar Desert
 an area of sand, scrub and thorn. The other is the region to the east of the Aravallis, which is more rain fed and hospitable.
The culture of Rajasthan is defined by the Rajputana kingdoms that ruled it for centuries; the word Rajput meaning sons of royalty. The Thar Desert region saw the 
Desert
 
Kingdoms
 of Marwar (modern 
Jodhpur
), 
Jaisalmer
, and 
Bikaner
. The east saw the kingdoms of Mewar (modern Chittor and 
Udaipur
), Amber (modern Amber and 
Jaipur
), and Hadoti (modern Bundi, 
Kota
 and Jhalawar) among many others. As a result, Rajasthan has a larger concentration of forts, palaces, and royal riches than any other place in 
India
. This is the reason why tourism is a primary pillar of the economy; apart from agriculture and cattle rearing. Several palaces or abandoned fortresses have been converted to Heritage Hotels to attract visitors and provide an income for the erstwhile princes. 
The capital 
Jaipur
, with its many imposing buildings made of rosy sandstone, is called 
Pink
 
City
. The 
City
 
Palace
 complex and Hawa Mahal are examples of Rajasthani-Mughal architecture. The old parts of town offer shopping such as jewellery, hand-dyed clothes, precious stones and craftwork. 
Jaipur
 has an international airport.
Udaipur
 has many lakes, lakeside palaces, and the largest palace complex (
City
 
Palace
) in Rajasthan. 
Jaisalmer
 fort is made of yellow sandstone such that it's called the Golden Fort. 
Jaisalmer
 also gives access to pristine sand dunes of Sam and Khuri, with camel safaris and nomadic music. The 
Amber Fort
 (near 
Jaipur
, 16thcentury); the 
Chittor Fort
; 
Junagarh Fort
 (at 
Bikaner
); 
Mehrangarh Fort
, (at 
Jodhpur
, 15thcentury) are among the main fortress attractions. 
The 
Shekhawati
 region in the north east offers painted havelis belonging to old business families.

Mt Abu
India's smallest state 
Goa
 is located on the western coast of the country, adjoining the Arabian Sea, which provides the beach holidays that Goa is internationally famous for. The states of 
Maharashtra
 in the north and 
Karnataka
 in the south and east surround 
Goa
. Together with the coastal stretches of these states, 
Goa
 is part of a larger cultural region known as Konkan. 
Northern Goa
 is more populated and urban, while the south is more forested. Beaches apart, rice fields and coconut plantations dominate the landscape. However, tourism is 
Goa
's main industry.
For 450 years Goa was a Portuguese colony until taken over by 
India
 in 1961. This heritage is still apparent in the architecture of its churches and old houses, and the culture of its towns, which is very distinct from the rest of 
India
. In the Catholic world 
Goa
 is important as the place where St Francis Xavier is buried (in the Basilica de Bom Jesus at Old Goa). Apart from 
Christmas
 and 
New Year
 celebrations, the 3-day long Goa Carnival (February, Panaji) and the 
Feast of St Francis
 (3 Dec, Old Goa) are famous attractions.
From north to south, the 
Goa
 coastline is marked by a number of 
beach towns
, with relaxed ambience, seafood and water sports such as wind surfing, water skiing, sailing, water-scooters, and dolphin spotting cruises. The beaches of 
Calangute
 and 
Baga
 are the most visited while other famous beaches include 
Arambol
, 
Anjuna
, 
Candolim
, 
Colva
 and 
Palolem
.
Panaji
 is the state capital, a city of peaceful walks in the old Portuguese quarters, and cruises on 
Goa
's main river, Mandovi. Nearby is the earlier capital city of 
Old Goa
 with its celebrated cathedrals, abandoned in the 19th century due to a persistent epidemic. 
Margao
 town is another centre of Portuguese cultural heritage. 
Ponda
 stands out for its Hindu temples built between 15th and 18th centuries. The international airport, Dabolim, is 29 km from Panaji. Humid for much of the year, 
Goa
's peak season is November-February, especially Christmas-New Year time, for when advance bookings are essential. 
Jammu & Kashmir
 is 
India
's northernmost state, sharing international borders with 
Pakistan
 and 
Tibet
, with 
Himachal Pradesh
 to its south. It comprises three very different topographic and cultural regions: 
Jammu
 region, 
Kashmir
 
Valley
 and 
Ladakh-Leh
. 
Jammu
 city is in the south of the state and is the only region that lies in plains and foothills and is the capital of the state for winter. 
Kashmir
 
Valley
 to the north of 
Jammu
 has higher elevations, encompassed by the Pir Panjal range on the west and parts of the Great Himalayas on the north east. 
Srinagar
 town, the heart of the valley is Jammu & Kashmir's summer capital. 
Ladakh
 region is a mountain desert terrain and takes up almost 2/3rds of J&K's territory from the centre to the east.
The natural beauty of the 
Kashmir
 valley has been a byword for centuries. The 17th-century Mughal emperors retreated here for summers and built some famous gardens. 
Srinagar
 town is defined by the River Jhelum, the Dal and Nagin Lakes, canals and backwaters, as well as old wooden architecture and 17th century mosques. Nearby 
Gulmarg
 (2730m) is a meadow with one of the highest golf courses in the world and one of India's rare ski resorts.
In contrast to the valley's comfortable altitudes, 
Ladakh
 region
 is so high that it receives no monsoon rains. The Ladakhi peaks go up to the 7135 m (
Nun
 
Peak
) in the Great Himalayas range and 7464m of the Teram Kangri 1 Peak in the 
Karakoram range
. The region is interspersed with oasis-villages. 
Ladakh
 has been home to Mahayana Buddhism for a thousand years and has noted monasteries along the River Indus: 
Alchi
, 
Basgo
, 
Thikse
, 
Hemis
 and 
Lamayuru
. 
Ladakh'
s
 capital
 
Ladakh'
 is a good base for visiting these and for trekking. Snowbound 
Ladakh
 is closed off by road between October-June.
Tourism was J&K's main industry till 1989 when political insurgency began here. Get the latest information on the prevailing situation before visiting the state.

[u'It is a change to see the different environment and pilgrims nearby and also to have a great change. When you are particular to visit with family all the things you should be able to look after is available at these places. Again because of common language used in general also helps or atleast never has any difficulty.', u'Visited Omkareshwar, Mohenkheda, Ratlam, Jabua, Indore, water park, hiking, camping and many more loved it. It was so much fun. Ujjan is an awesome historical place are there like shivling temple, bharat cave, maha kumb, naga baba rituals and babas amazing avatars etc.', u"Madhya Pradesh is good. Amarkantak is a origin of Narmada river. It is widely known as 'Queen of Satpura'\xc3\x82\xc2\x9d. Pachmarhi lies in Hoshangabad district of among all tourist spots of Madhya Pradesh, Pachmarhi is the most favourite tourist spot among domestic tourists of India. Mostly it is visited by domestic tourists from all over the India specially from Maharashtra, Gujarat, West Bengal. Pachmarhi sightseeing is of 2-3 days long. Satpura National Park is also another attraction for Pachmarhi visitors. Tigers are there in Park.", u"Having heard a lot about 'Hindustan's dil', we planned a trip to the state, covering Sanchi, Bhopal, Panchmarhi, Bedaghat, Amarkantak, Bandhabgarh, Kajuraho and Orchha, in November, 2015. The entire trip was organized by MP Tourism, Delhi office. It was hassel free and the overall experience was good. However, there are a few points that need to be taken care of to improve tourism in the state.", u'Of prime importance are the roads which are narrow and bad in a few stretches like a ten km stretch before Kajuraho. There are no facilities on the highway. Even a basic toilet facility is lacking and hence one has to wait for five or six hours till the next destination, to relieve oneself. This is especially difficult for ladies. There are no eateries worth the name and so we often had to go hungry while travelling from one place to the other.', u'The places of tourist importance, except the ones under the archaeological society of India, are in a poor state, with no maintenance and often very dirty. The river bank of Betwa river at Orchha is just filthy with human excreta, as it is a religious place. Administration does nothing to keep the place clean. The palace and temples in Orchha are in a sorry state with people spitting gutka and pan masala all over. Amarkantak is a dirty town with nothing to see. The place is highly overrated.', u"The marble rocks and falls at Bedaghat are wonderful natural beauties but again hardly maintained. The area near the falls is very dirty and the river bank stinking. The state administration must do everything possible to keep these places of tourist interest clean before advertising 'Hindustan ka dil dekho'. It was disappointing and I don't think I want to go back to the state.", u'From Vadodara, need to board train to Meghngar. From Meghnagar hire a car to Mohan Kheda. Place is famous for Jain temple. Nearby you can find places for sightseeing like indore. Good for Vegetarians. As you travel during this many places will be explored. Plan for long trip and enjoy the holiday.', u"This place is probably something you haven't heard about. This is not a review of Madhya Pradesh but a tiny city there, but it has the ability to you out of this world, but only if you drench yourself in it. Now, the city is around 180 kilometres (110 mi) northeast of state capital, Bhopal. Its original name 'Saugor' is an amalgamation of two words: sau meaning 100 and gahr meaning forts; there were countless small-forts in this region. With time the name has changed from 'Saugor' to 'Sagar'. So, yes! The forts of course are an attraction. It has a small population. Sagar itself was also a wonderful discovery three hours drive south of Bhopal, it's well and truly off the tourist track. A major university and army cantonment town, Sagar also was the exact centre of undivided India. The town now sprawls prettily around a lake fringed with temples. Some of the old town is so beautiful I wanted to rush around with a preservation order to stop the inevitable blight of new concrete monstrosities. Away from the the hustle-bustle and pollution, it is a treat for all. The naturalness is mesmerizing. (And yes, do not go there in monsoon season, half the things are closed) But, as always for me, the food was the main attraction. Fresh food, fresh air :) I met new ingredients (like chiraunji which tastes a little like pine nuts), learned new techniques and scribbled down so much I don't really know when I'll find the time to blog it all. I learned how to make two types of Laddoos, and so much more. In the end, if you ever go to Sagar or anywhere in close proximity, 5 must visit places are:-", u'1. Lake of Sagar', u'2. Shri Raj Mandir Bhapel', u'3. Radha Talkies (only if you are a cinema person)', u'4. Dhana Airstrip', u'5. Phuler Mela Mahadev Temple (for the spiritual ones)', u'It is a place of silence and peace, but I assure that you will never get bored there even if you are not the peace kind of a person. (Even I am not :P)', u"This is located in between India and this is the place where mostly people come here to enjoy and most of them come for their study's purpose. This state is very popular among all the states, this is because of the nature and here many famous places are there which can be visited with family. Finally, I will say all of you must visit once.", u'Have visited lot of heritage sites such as Sanchi stupa, Khajuraho, Mahakaleshwar, Omkareshwar, Ujjain, Bhimbetka, Gwalior . The entire trip was a potpourri of fun, frolic with a dash of spiritual bliss sprinkled within. The weather was conducive to travel but a little hot in the day and damp in the night. ', u'Sanchi Stupa is a fine example of exemplary skill in architecture. The very simple style of living of Buddhist monks (granaries, small hamlets) and depiction of their beliefs through tales sculptured on huge monolithic rocks are eye-catching. ', u'Bhimbetka caves are a marvel with their more than 10,000 years old carvings and drawings. Such exquisite drawings make one feel proud of the rich heritage the country boasts.', u'Mahakaleshwar and Omkareshwar are 2 Jyotirlingas worth visiting. The grandeur of the temples and the devotion which embraces the temple campus is worth mentioning. Ujjain is a site of Hindu pilgrimage of great significance with a large number of temples and relics that trace back to period when gods existed.', u'The food is quite spicy but simple. Ujjain was popular for jalebis and poha.', u'A visit to Bhopal revealed that the people of MP have a liking for art, culture and music. A night of opera or concert of classical music is relished with aplomb. ', u'The Museum of Mankind needs special mention with artifacts, handicrafts, utensils belonging to all kind of tribes living in all parts of India displayed as in real life. The huge compound of mosque Taja-ul-Masjid holds one in awe. The city of Bhopal is busy, full of life and very vibrant with a blend of old and new culture.', u'Gwalior needs a very special mention. Gwalior Fort with its size and grandeur, Jal Vilas Museum with insight into lifestyle of kings and queens leave one dazed and amazed at the sight of royalty, Sas bahu temple is worth visiting due to its beautiful sculptures and 360 degree view of Fort, Gurudwara, temples, Other sites of mention are Teli-ka-Mandir, Sun Temple, Gurjari Mahal and Tomb of TanSen. The light show at Gwalior Fort enriches one about the proud history of the bravery and valor of our great kings and warriors.', u'One should be careful while taking advice / guidance from people. A pre-scheduled itinerary will serve as great help. Consult acquaintances before deciding mode of travel. Wear light coloured clothes.', u'I visited Madhya Pradesh in month of March 2011 with my friends and I enjoyed every movement of my life here. You can see true nature and I think it was one of the best place in India. I visit Madhya Pradesh with my friends but you can go with your family and enjoy.', u'There are nice and wonderful places to visit in Madhya Pradesh like Chhindwara, Patalkot and Pachmani. All these are awesome places to hang out with friends, family and colleagues. The best mode to watch the natural green beauty of nature is ride by bike. You must go once to watch the real beauty of nature. Overall, it was a great place.']

[u"There is so much to see, so much to explore, so much to discover and so much to assimilate here. I once read somewhere that if someone wants to see true India then they must come to Rajasthan. This is that one single place which encompasses of so much culture; ethos, tradition, and heritage that I sometimes wonder how could there be an awful lot of varieties in this one locale? Once a person comes here they will go back with a tranche of their heart lying here. And that's the reason people love to visit here again and again. Cities of Rajasthan which should be on your must visit lists are Jaipur, Udaipur, Ajmer, Pushkar, Jodhpur & Jaiselmer. For wildlife lovers Ranthambore national park is a heaven.", u'Very good state and very nice people. Food is spicy but delicious. Must enjoy traditional food and dance also. Very good traditional clothes also purchase over here. Take camel ride in dessert. On the way to Rajasthan many places are there to explore.', u'SHOW PRICES', u'Map', u'Save', u'*Prices above are the average nightly price including base rate, taxes and fees as provided by our partners. Please see our partners for full details.', u'Hotel Information', u'Official Description', u"Rajasthan Palace Hotel is known for the high end service it has been serving its visitors since 1989.

Rajasthan's people is very honesty. Jaipur is heart of Rajasthan. Jaipur was called pink city. Many spot is here like heaven. I am very happy to my trip of Rajasthan. Awesome.", u'Hi guys this an awesome place and it does not matter whether you are there or not... But you will feel very cultural with this and as I said this is an awesome and amazing place. Rajisthan is place where we can say the soul of India is. This place so many cultures and having different place for staying, playing and riding on horse it is a good place where we can get a lot of soul feeling.', u'To. Nice view very good condition and must have been trying to find out more information about the same time as the other hand, and she was in my life. I will surrounding area of expertise and the surrounding areas of interest to the right place for you to do with it, but it was a great time in 50th birthday party on 5th of my life, and a bit of the 683. This will not be a good day for the delay, I 21st century and the surrounding area, and a half years', u'I visited many places, Rajasthan is famous for respectiveness. Since two months I went to Rajasthan with my friends and by my car. The journey took almost two days. We took rest at hotels and continued the ride with car. Firstly we visited the Thar Desert which is in Rajasthan, it consists of total sand and the place was totally hot. Even water also not available, have taken the water with us. It was helpful for me because water was not available in Thar desert. Then we visited the Raj Mahals and restaurantsd, the restaurants are really nice and the main thing I liked here is food which was superb. The Rajasthanies are really so peaceful and respective persons. They treat us in a respective manner. I am very tired with my car, I prefer travels for the next time. With the car my health was upset, I suggest travels or train to visit the Rajasthan instead of car.', u'Rajasthan is the famous place place for traditions. Since two months ago I went to Rajasthan via Sai Sri Krishna travels. All of my family members were already seen the Rajasthan since two years ago. I am the first to see. I saw all the places in Rajasthan. I saw the Thar desert which was awaesome. It is totally sand and very hot area. I take a rest in one home. They treated me as very respective manner. I like their traditions. Such as sarees wearing style, dressing styles, etc were really so good. I think Rajasthan people are the best people in India. No other places people can maintain their home and all things in such a good manner. My best visited places is the Rajasthan only. I visited delhi also. But Delhi is totally rusty and jumbled area. No peaceful are is Delhi only. But Rajasthan is the peaceful area. Especially Jaipur is no clean and neat. All people and places are very very attractive. Rajasthan kings olden palaces are looking so good. I ate the food at one hotel which was located in Jaipur. The food was so tasty and I ate the food in one hotel only.', u"Rajasthan has now become one of my favourite holiday destination. There is so much to see there. Palaces, Forts, Museums, Havelis, Lakes, Temples etc etc and the list is endless. The state has so much history to learn about. Beautiful architecture all around. Very god hospitality. Great food. Great road infrastructure enables ease in moving around. Everyone must visit this. I can't wait for my next visit to this beautiful state. Considering dry climate, one should choose to go there during cooler months like November to February.", u'Visiting Rajasthan, India with Kesari Tours & Travels.', u'My wife & I did a 15 day Rajasthan Mewar & Marwad Coach Tour with Kesari Tours.', u'The organization by Kesari reminded us of tours of Europe with COSMOS. This Company has all the required clout and the Tour Conductors were knowledgable, polite & respectfully firm. Guides provided by the tour operators were knowledgeable, patient, humorous & eloquent in Hindi. Hotels were beautiful specially Udaivilas at Udaipur, Bhanwar Singh Palace at Pushkar, Sarovar Portico Jaipur (car parking outside hotel on kerbside) & Desert Tulip at Jaisalmer. The places covered included Mt. Abu, Udaipur, Chittorgarh, Ranthambor Natural Reserve (with a safari), Ajmer Sharif Dargah, Pushkar, Jaipur, Bikaner, the famous rat temple, Natdwar, Bikaner, Jaisalmer, Pokaran & Jodhpur.', u"The rich history of Mewar and Maharana Pratap with his horse Chetak were depicted in all their pristine glory at Udaipur & Chittorgarh. The castles which often included several steps to be climbed were indeed fascinating. History revealed once again that wars are fought for religion, plunder or beauty. The abundance of temples and the possibility to conclude different forms of last rites for the 'departed' at Pushkar was a boon to the Hindu travellers. The visit to the famous Chisty Dargah at Ajmer to pay homage to the Sufi Saint was a chance of a life time.", u'The museums intrigued us all but the battle of Haldighati as related in the museum at Haldighati took the cake. This was followed by a delicious lunch served with Rajasthani cuisine, by far the best meal on the tour. Vegetarian & adorable. For that matter all the hotels where we dined served excellent food. The Chef at hotel Sarovar Portico in Jaipur needs special mention. Visiting Choki-re-dhani at Jaipur proved a damp squib. The much anticipated visit was disappointing as the fare in the meal and the village atmosphere created were nothing to write home about.', u"At Jaisalmer the camel ride on camel back or the camel cart was enjoyable but the optional trip by camel cart into the Thar Dessert is a disappointment & at the mercy of the camel cart drivers who promise much but deliver nothing extra. Jeep Dessert Safari is available. The lure of the markets can be experienced at Jodhpur. Advisable to cater an empty bag for purchases like 'Juties' (shoes), semi precious stones jewelry & Rajasthani traditional clothes. The shop at the lunch halt hotel in Pokaran offers a decent array of buyable items at 25-30% discount. The items here were more classy than those available in other places & cheaper because of the discount. Credit Card accepted. This place is revisited on the return leg to Jodhpur from Jaisalmer.", u'The light & sound show at Udaipur City Palace repeats the history already described and is more of an audio presentation. The Lake Palace & Jag Mandir get automatically excluded at Udaipur because of paucity of time and heavy INR as cover charges. The war museum at Jaisalmer and its Indian Army shop was a big draw. A must visit area.', u"Wifi at Udaivilas & Bhanwar Singh Palace hotels was tricky & mostly unavailable. February weather was excellent in Rajasthan and a light sweater was enough. Kesari had included tips, guide remuneration & all entry tickets in the tour price so there was no extra expense on these counts. Some of the places had a Rs 30-50 camera charge and some places photography was not permitted. The ride on the 'hand pushed cart' up the slope to the sunset point at Mt Abu was an experience. Continuous hygienically packed snacks provided by Kesari kept us occupied through out the tour. The facility breaks were evenly spaced. Most days we had the 6, 7, 8 AM regime of wake-up call, breakfast and the day's departure respectively. Though it was a busy 15 days we as Senior Citizens could cope this tour with ease. We would like to do more of such tours in the Kesari Itinerary. We found co-travellers who had done 6-9 tours with Kesari already."]

Just for some relaxing you should go there and enjoy with your all family members. Enjoy some special arrangement in Dal lake.', u'It has been nice to be in Kashmir. But the beauty of Kashmir is not so as expected. The weather goes worse some days which was quiet disappointing. Had a temperature of 5 degree some days. Visited Taj Vivanta. An awesome point to be visited. It was so stunning to see beauty of nature here', u'J&K state has everything for every age group. If you have a love for mountains, yeah like the Alps one, and wanted to experience snowfall with big meadows(Gulmarg), then you have parked your car at the right place.', u"If you are a spiritual types(Jammu), then Vaishno Devi is a must visit place for you, Plus there's a small hill station(PatniTop) which is near to it, so you get a pilgrimage and a small weekend get away with less travel and more privacy.", u"But as they say, If there's heaven, its here, here and here( Srinagar city). Places to visit can be endless but mainly Dal lake(boulevard road), Shankracharya, Chashma shahi, Pehalgam, Shalimar and Gulmarg are few not be missed places.", u"Jammu city is having its only charm(esp'lly during winters) but to experience that beauty you might have to go to remote areas like Badarwah, Bani or even Akhnoor(for river Chenab). But the city is more or less like a developed tier 2 city where govt n business activities take the centrestage. Best to have a last stop to buy souvenirs from this god gifted state for best quality stuff like Kesar, Walnuts, Basmati, Rajmah etc.", u'Lastly its home to only snow desert in the country called Ladakh.

If you're planning to relax with your family or with partner then Kashmir is best option. You can easily hire innova or other cars by contacting hotel manager or travel agents whereas they also help you in bargain of hotel rooms in whole Kashmir like Srinagar or other places you can enjoy snowfall too but if you're planning about to visit Kashmir then bring at least one jacket with you because its too cold even in summers during night.", u"You can reach Jammu by train, bus or flight after that you can hire any cab from travel office whereas you can bargain in booking price too.

Next day we departed to Sonmarg to see the snow, and we were very lucky to see the snow in the higher reaches there. When we were returning back it started drizzling, it was awesome.', u'Same night we went to Dal lake, went for purchasing souvenirs for the trip.

People are also nice.", u"I have been to Kashmir and it's really good place and first time in life I saw a snow fall it's very good place its really a heaven on earth. And the dry fruits of Kashmir really good, especially Akhrod. Jammu is also good for religion people.", u'A best place to visit! A pleasant atmosphere, cool weather, healthy air, snow. No words to explain beauty. One should definitely visit the Himalaya and their snow covered summits. Dal lake, Shankaracharya temple, Gulmarg, Sonmarg are some spots.']
